## Overview

The project's scope involved developing a missing puzzle piece application using ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and Vite. Additionally, I worked on using various features to help build out this application to include a frontend and backend server.

### The challenge

This application was developed as a personal project to address a common issue faced by puzzle enthusiasts - the loss of puzzle pieces. When a piece goes missing, it's challenging to create a DIY replacement or order a new one from the manufacturer. As a result, the only viable option is to search for the lost piece. The absence of one or more pieces significantly reduces a puzzle's value. Therefore, I aimed to create a responsive application that offers an optimal layout across various device screen sizes, assisting users in their search for missing puzzle pieces.

## My process

My process for building this website involved planning, building and refractoring code. This project took me about 2-4 business days to complete start to finish.

Project planning:
1. I began by writing my thoughts surrounding the problem at hand on Substack. Based on this I decided what was the best way to approach this project to be the most efficient.

### What I learned

Throughout the development of this project, I gained a deeper understanding of several important concepts and tools. Here are the key learnings:

1. **Tailwind CSS Setup:** The config file has updated terminology - `purge` is now `content`. Also, `app.css` should have the Tailwind CSS utilities. At the beginning of the project, I spent some time reconfiguring the section in order to work.
2. **React useState Hook:** I learned the importance of correctly declaring the state variable and the function to update it inside an array using `useState`. I gained a deeper understanding of this concept throughout the navigation bar coding.
4. **React Router Dom:** Gained a deeper understanding of `react-router-dom` and how it works within all the files. It is a library for routing in React applications. It allows to create multiple routes in the application and render different components. I am able to create SPAs while not navigating through multiple pages and refreshing.

### Continued development

Throughout this project, I learned a lot about Tailwind CSS, styling and how all the applications work together. I very much enjoyed creating an application from nothing. I will continue learning through freeCodeCamp, Frontend Mentor challenges and self-application.
